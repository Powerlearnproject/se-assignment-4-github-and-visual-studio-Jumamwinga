Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Introduction to Visual Studio:

GitHub Actions enable automated workflows directly within GitHub repositories, automating tasks like building, testing, and deploying applications. Workflows are defined in YAML files and triggered by events such as commits or pull requests. Each workflow consists of jobs that run concurrently on virtual machines or containers, executing steps like installing dependencies, running tests, and deploying applications. GitHub Actions integrate with external services and community-provided actions to streamline development processes, enforce best practices, and accelerate software delivery with reliability and efficiency.

Example of a Simple CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions:
A GitHub Actions workflow triggers on pushes to the main branch. It includes two jobs: build, which checks out code, installs dependencies, and runs tests, and deploy, which deploys the application to production if the build job succeeds. Secrets like API keys are securely accessed from GitHub secrets. This automated CI/CD pipeline ensures consistent, efficient delivery of software updates while maintaining code quality and reliability.

What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?
